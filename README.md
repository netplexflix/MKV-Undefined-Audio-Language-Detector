# üé¨ MKV Undefined Audio Language Detector (MUALD) üó£Ô∏è

Ever downloaded a movie or TV show only to find the audio tracks are labeled as "undefined" or "unknown" in your media player?</br>
This script solves that problem by:

1. Scanning your video files for audio tracks with undefined audio language
2. Extracting audio samples
3. Using AI speech recognition to detect the language [(OpenAI's Whisper)](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
4. Updating the file metadata with the correct language code

The script optionally remuxes non MKV video formats to MKV first.

Create a config file with the following command:
```sh
python MUALD.py --create-config
```

and change the values where needed:
```
path: P:\Movies #Main Path for your media
remux_to_mkv: true #change to false if you don't want to process non-MKV files
show_details: false #change to true if you want more details of what's happening
whisper_model: base #see Model Size Guide below
dry_run: false #change to true for a dry run (will show what it would do, without actually altering any files)
```

### Model Size Guide

* **tiny:** Fastest, least accurate
* **base:** Good balance (recommended for most users)
* **small:** More accurate, slower
* **medium:** Very accurate, much slower
