# üé¨ MKV Undefined Audio Language Detector (MUALD) üó£Ô∏è

Ever downloaded a movie or TV show only to find the audio tracks are labeled as "undefined" or "unknown" in your media player?</br>
This script solves that problem by:

1. Scanning your video files for audio tracks with undefined audio language
2. Extracting audio samples
3. Using AI speech recognition to detect the language [(Faster-Whisper)](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)
4. Updating the file metadata with the correct language code

The script optionally remuxes non MKV video formats to MKV first.

Requires 
- [Python >=3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- [MKVToolNix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the script
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/netplexflix/MKV-Undefined-Audio-Language-Detector.git
cd MKV-Undefined-Audio-Language-Detector
```

![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) Or simply download by pressing the green 'Code' button above and then 'Download Zip'.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
- Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed (`>=3.11` recommended)
- Open a Terminal in the script's directory
>[!TIP]
>Windows Users: <br/>
>Go to the script folder (where MUALD.py is).</br>
>Right mouse click on an empty space in the folder and click `Open in Windows Terminal`
- Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Rename `config.example.yml` to `config.yml` and change the values where needed:

```
path: #Main Paths for your media.
  - P:/Movies
  - P:/TV
remux_to_mkv: true #change to false if you don't want to process non-MKV files
show_details: false #change to true if you want more details of what's happening
whisper_model: small #see Model Size Guide below
dry_run: false #change to true for a dry run (will show what it would do, without actually altering any files)
```

### Model Size Guide

* **tiny:** Fastest, least accurate
* **base:** Good balance
* **small:** More accurate, slower (used during development tests)
* **medium:** Very accurate, much slower
* **large:** Most accurate, very slow


### Expert variables

> [!TIP]
>You can create a config file with a few expert variables by using the following command:
>```sh
>python MUALD.py --create-config
>```

Only Change these if you know what you're doing.
* `vad_filter`: Enables Voice Activity Detection to filter out silence and background noise before language analysis (Default: True)
* `vad_min_speech_duration_ms`: Minimum speech segment length (in milliseconds) to consider as valid speech (Default: 250)
* `vad_max_speech_duration_s`: Maximum continuous speech segment length (in seconds) before splitting (Default: 30)
* `device`: Hardware acceleration preference (auto, cpu, or cuda). Auto-detects CUDA GPU if available, falls back to CPU (Default: "auto")
* `compute_type`: Precision/performance trade-off (auto, int8, float16, float32). Auto-selects optimal type based on device (Default: "auto")
* `cpu_threads`:Number of CPU threads to use. 0 = automatic detection based on system cores (Default: 0)
* `confidence_threshold`: Minimum confidence level (0.0-1.0) required to accept language detection from audio samples. If sample-based detection falls below this threshold, the entire audio track is analyzed for improved accuracy. Higher values are more conservative but reduce false positives. (Default: 0.9)
* `reprocess_all` : When set to `true` the script will reprocess ALL audio tracks, even if they already have a language tag. (Default: `false`)

## üöÄ Usage

Run the script with:
```sh
python MUALD.py
```

> [!TIP]
> Windows users can create a batch file for quick launching:
> ```batch
> "C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe" "Path\To\Script\MUALD.py"
> pause
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> A warning will be given at the end of a run for any files that were marked as 'zxx' (no linguistic content).<br>
> While it is perfectly possible for a video file to have no linguistic content (silent movies, old Disney cartoons, etc), these could also indicate AI 'hallucinations'.
> You may want to manually check these files. <br><br>
> If a file is marked as failed, it is likely corrupt. Manually remux or replace it.

## üìÑ Supported File Formats
Always Processed:
* **MKV files:** Primary target format

With `remux_to_mkv: true`
* MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WebM, M4V, M2TS, MTS, TS, VOB
* Note: Original files are deleted after successful conversion

* example run with reprocess_all: true: Samsara is indeed a documentary without spoken dialogue.
